#How its Made
CSS, HTML, JavaScript

This is a Random WuTang Clan name generator. This allows the user to answer questions and then click submit. On the click event for submit the user is given a randomly generated name from one of the WuTangs members.


##If I had more time

If I had more time I would make it so that the answers dictate the name you get. Currently I have an application that only works when you answer ALL of the questions correctly and then it geneartes a name.
