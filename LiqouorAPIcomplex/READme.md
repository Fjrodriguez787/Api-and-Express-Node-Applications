#How its Made

API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This is an API for different liquors one is interested in learning about combined with an API for drink recipes that contain your liquor of choice.

First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from Wiki and the Drinks API.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.



##If I had more time

If I had more time, I would make the API information run when a button is clicked instead of rendering the API on LOAD

###Lesson Learned
Initially the API's were a considerable challenge for me. I would get one of them working and it was not until I took both of the API's and laid them out seperatley and treated them like two separate API's in my main.js file that I got them to work and append my HTML.
