#How its Made
API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This is an API for FEMA reports on the top 50 natural disasters that occurred  that updates on all of NASA's listed facilities with their locations.

First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from NASA.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.



##If I had more time

If I had more time, I would make it so that people can search a type of natural disaster and then they can choose a year so that any disaster that meets those requirements shows up
