      <h2>About Indoor Arboretum</h2>
      <p>The automatic plant monitoring system has recently attracted tremendous interest due to the potential application in emerging technology. More importantly, this technique is used to enhance the performance of existing techniques or to develop and design new techniques for the growth of plants. The plant monitoring system is helpful for watering the plants and to monitor few parameters for growth of plants. This system is very used in few areas like nursery farms and in agriculture. In this system a mechanism is established to find the moisture content in the soil with the help of soil moisture sensor and depending upon the condition of the sensor the water is controlled. Other such factors that a plant monitoring system should be able to do is let the user know temperature, UV light monitor, as well as a monitor for soil PH levels. The hope is that people can share their recipes to success when it comes to planting.
