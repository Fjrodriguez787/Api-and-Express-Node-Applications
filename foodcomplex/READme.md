#How its Made

API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node, Express, Mongo db

This is an API for Wiki foods and an API that gives you cultural information on the dish.

First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from NASA and Weather API.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.

This application is hosted on a local server, and uses a Mongo db to allow comments to be made on the different food dishes

##If I had more time

If I had more time, I would make it so that the image of the food does not disappear when the form / comment is submitted

###Lesson Learned
Initially the API's were a considerable challenge for me. I would get one of them working and it was not until I took both of the API's and laid them out seperatley and treated them like two separate API's in my main.js file that I got them to work and append my HTML.
