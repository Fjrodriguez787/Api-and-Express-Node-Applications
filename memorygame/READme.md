#How its Made
JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Made a simple game where a user can tap a card that reveals a logo on it. IF the logos match then the cards dissapear. Your number of turns is tracked so that you can see how long it takes you to complete all of the matches.


##If I had more time

If I had more time I would make it so that people could restart the game with a button, and currently when a second card is clicked it shows you the logo if they match, but the logo will not show up if there is no match.
