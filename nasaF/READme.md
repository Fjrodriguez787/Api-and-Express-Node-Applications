#How its Made
API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This is an API for NASA's facilities that updates on all of NASA's listed facilities with their locations.

First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from NASA.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.



##If I had more time

If I had more time, I would make the API information run when a button is clicked instead of rendering the API on LOAD
