#How its Made

node, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This application allows the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors

It is designed to make the user play against a bot

You will make a choice and press the corresponding button, it will randomly generate a bot response using Math.random, and based on the bots choice you either WIN, LOSE, or DRAW

##If I had more time

If I had more time I would make it so that two people using the application from two separate devices could play against one another

###Lesson Learned

I learned a lot about math.random and the variety of ways in which making an option random helps with different functionality.
