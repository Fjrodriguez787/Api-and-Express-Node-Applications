#How its Made

API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This is an API for NASA's for NASA's picture of the day
First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from NASA and Weather API.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.



##If I had more time

If I had more time I would pull more information on the image/video that is being pulled on the date requested
