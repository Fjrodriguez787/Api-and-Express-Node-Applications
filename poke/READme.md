#How its Made
ejs, JavaScript, CSS, MONGO db, Mlab(for the DataBase), Express, Node

The Objective with this project is to have a fan site where people can leave comments, like and dislike comments others post, and delete comments. In order to get this up and running I needed to host my own server and use an ejs file in place of my HTML. Following CRUD, this project can Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  

##If I had more time

If I had more time I would like to make it so that people can identify themselves when they leave a comment so that there is more control over the content

###Lesson Learned
In this assignment I went through a few headaches trying to get the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to work. It seemed like whenever I fixed the up button, the down button would break.
When both worked the delete button did not.

I learned to make small changes to my code at a time and really getting in the habit of checking what changes my code is causing. It is harder to backtrack from a broken code, when you make 10 changes at a time.
