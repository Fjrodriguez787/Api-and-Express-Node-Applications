#How its Made

API using AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This is an API for NASA's facilities and a weather API combined in order to give you the weather updates on all of NASA's listed facilities.

First I had to find the correct end points for the information I wanted to grab from NASA and Weather API.

I had to then get authentication and access to the API's with a Key provided to me.



##If I had more time

If I had more time, I would make the API information run when a button is clicked instead of rendering the API on LOAD

###Lesson Learned
Initially the API's were a considerable challenge for me. I would get one of them working and it was not until I took both of the API's and laid them out seperatley and treated them like two separate API's in my main.js file that I got them to work and append my HTML.
